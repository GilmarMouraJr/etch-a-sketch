This is a project based on using JavaScript to make a web application based on the Etch-a-Sketch toy.
It is based on creating a square grid of divs based on user input.
When the mouse hovers over each div, they change color and increase in opacity, until they are fully opaque.
The refresh button deletes the divs and creates new ones.
